 *  \brief Universal Serial Bus (USB) Driver
 *
 * The USB Driver (for USB device only, no support for USB Host) is meant to
 * use usb hardware to communicate with external devices connected on the USB
 * bus.
 *
 * @section mdev_usb_usage Usage
 *
 * A typical USB device usage scenario is as follows:
 *
 * -# Initialize the USB driver using usb_drv_init(usb_class).
 * -# Open the USB device handle using usb_drv_open() call.
 * -# Use usb_drv_read() or usb_drv_write() calls to read USB data or
 *  to write data to USB respectively.
 * -# Close the USB device using usb_drv_close() after its use.
 *
 * Code snippet:\n
 * Following code demonstrates how to use USB driver APIs for read/write
 * operation, it reads 4 bytes and echoes them back.
 *
 * @code
 * {
 *  int ret, timeout;
 *  mdev_t *usb_dev;
 *  char buf[4];
 *
 *  ret = usb_drv_init(USB_CDC_CLASS);
 *  if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *  	return;
 *  usb_dev = usb_drv_open("MDEV_USB");
 *  if (usb_dev == NULL)
 *  	return;
 *
 *  timeout = 60;
 *  ret = usb_drv_read(usb_dev, buf, sizeof(buf), timeout, 2);
 *  if (ret != 0 && ret != WM_E_USB_TIMEOUT_ERROR &&
 *         ret != WM_E_USB_CONNECTION_ERROR)
 *	usb_drv_write(usb_dev, buf, sizeof(buf), timeout, 2);
 *
 *  usb_drv_close(usb_dev);
 * }
 * @endcode
