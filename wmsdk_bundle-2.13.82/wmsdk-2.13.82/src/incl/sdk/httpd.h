 *  \brief HTTP Web Server
 *
 * HTTP Web Server can serve static pages from a file system, dynamic content
 * using a server-side include (SSI) capability, and dynamic content using
 * custom web service gateway interface (WSGI) handlers.  This documentation
 * describes:
 * -# How to initialize, start, stop, and shutdown the server.
 * -# How static files are served.
 * -# How to implement WSGI handlers.
 * -# How the SSI directives "file" and "virtual" are processed.
 * Several limitations that may be unexpected by programmers accustomed to using
 * more sophisticated web servers and frameworks are also discussed.
 *
 * \section httpd_usage Usage
 *
 * httpd must be initialized by calling \ref httpd_init.  After \ref httpd_init
 * returns WM_SUCESS, \ref httpd_start and \ref httpd_stop can be called to
 * start and stop the server respectively.  Finally, to perform a final cleanup,
 * \ref httpd_shutdown should be called.  After a successful call to
 * httpd_start, the server is listening for connections on \ref HTTP_PORT or
 * \ref HTTPS_PORT.
 *
 * The WSGI and SSI handlers can be registered by calling the functions
 * httpd_register_wsgi_handler() and httpd_register_ssi().
 *
 * When a client request is made, httpd first checks if the requested URI
 * matches any registered WSGI handlers (see below). If a matching handler is
 * found it gets executed and the processing is terminated. If a file matching
 * the requested URI is found, it is served.  If that file is a .shtml file, it
 * is processed for directives as described in the file handling section.
 *
 * \section wsgi Web Services Gateway Interface (WSGI)
 *
 * The Web Services Gateway Interface (WSGI) allows developers to take complete
 * control over how HTTP requests are processed. When a request arrives, its
 * request method (or type) and URI are parsed. A table of all registered WSGI
 * handlers is queried for any matches. If an exact match is obtained, the
 * control is transferred to the corresponding WSGI handler. If the
 * WSGI handler returns WM_SUCCESS, no further processing is performed.
 * In case
 * A 500 Internal Server Error is returned to the client:
 * -# When any other value than WM_SUCCESS is returned by the WSGI handler.
 *
 * A 404 Not Found Error is returned to the client:
 * -# If no handler (including the file system) matches the incoming URI
 * -# If incoming request type is not supported by that WSGI
 *
 * A WSGI handler typically is executed in response to a HTTP GET or
 * HTTP POST operation. In case of HTTP GET, the handler fetches some
 * data from the device, formats it as desired and sends it to the
 * requester. In case of HTTP POST, the handler reads the data that is
 * sent along with the POST request and takes some action on the
 * device. The WSGI handlers can make use of some of the common httpd
 * helper functions to perform tasks pertaining to the
 * sending/receiving of the data.
 *
 * A simple WSGI HTTP GET handler is shown below:
 * Example: JSON Time Get
 *
 * \code
 * int sys_get_time(httpd_request_t *req)
 * {
 *	char content[30];
 *	time_t time_val;
 *
 *	some_api_to_fetch_time(&time_val)
 *	snprintf(content, sizeof(content), "{\"epoch\":%d}", time_val);
 *
 *	return httpd_send_response(req, HTTP_RES_200
 *		, content, strlen(content), HTTP_CONTENT_JSON_STR);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * A simple WSGI HTTP POST handler is shown below:
 * Example: JSON Time Set
 *
 * \code
 * int sys_set_time(httpd_request_t *req)
 * {
 *	char sys_time_req[30];
 *	int ret;
 *	time_t time_val;
 *
 *	ret = httpd_get_data_json(req, sys_time_req,
 *		sizeof(sys_time_req), &obj);
 *	if (ret < 0) {
 *		wmprintf("Failed to get post request data");
 *		return ret;
 *	}
 *	json_get_val_int(&obj, "epoch", (int *)&time_val);
 *
 *	ret = Set the time using the value time_val func()
 *	if (ret == WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return httpd_send_response(req, HTTP_RES_200
 *		   , HTTPD_JSON_SUCCESS, strlen(HTTPD_JSON_SUCCESS),
 *		   HTTP_CONTENT_JSON_STR);
 *	else
 *		return httpd_send_response(req, HTTP_RES_200
 *		   , HTTPD_JSON_ERROR, strlen(HTTPD_JSON_ERROR),
 *		   HTTP_CONTENT_JSON_STR);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above examples being simplest examples use the most convenient
 * functions, namely httpd_send_response() and httpd_get_data_json()
 * for most of their tasks. An advanced user may prefer to have more
 * flexibility by using functions that provide a greater control. To
 * enable this, the exact set of steps that are performed by both
 * these functions is documented below.
 *
 * - httpd_send_response()
 *   -# Purge HTTP headers (valid only for GET request) : httpd_purge_headers()
 *   -# Send response status (200 OK/404 Not Found etc.): httpd_send()
 *   -# Send the default headers from \ref httpd_hdr_field_sel_t :
 *      httpd_send_default_headers()
 *   -# Send the Content-Type of the response : httpd_send_header()
 *   -# Send the header terminator : httpd_send_crlf()
 *   -# Send the chunked data : httpd_send_chunk()
 *   -# Send the last chunk : httpd_send_chunk() with length = 0
 *   .
 * .
 *
 * - httpd_get_data_json()
 *   -# httpd_get_data()
 *     -# Parse the received headers : httpd_parse_hdr_tags()
 *     -# Receive the POST data : httpd_recv()
 *     .
 *   -# Initialize the JSON object : json_object_init()
 *   .
 * .
 *
 * \section files Static File Handling
 *
 * Static files can be served from a filesystem. A WSGI handler can be
 * registered at '/'. This handler can call httpd_handle_file() for dealing with
 * file serving requests. If the fs contains a file called /404.html, this file
 * will be returned when httpd receives a request for a URL that does not have a
 * registered handler or page.  The following table summarizes the Content-Types
 * with which files of various file extensions are served:
 *
 | Extension | Content-Type |
 | ----:---- | --------- |
 | .html | text/html (with charset=iso8859-1) |
 | .shtml | same as .html but with caching disabled |
 | .css | text/css |
 | .png | image/png |
 | .gif | image/gif |
 | .jpg | image/jpeg |
 | [none] | application/octet-stream |
 | [other] | text/plain |
 *
 * \subsection gzip_handling Compressed Files
 *
 * If the request for a file <em>abc.html</em> is received, the web server first
 * tries to check if a compressed version of this file <em>abc.html.gz</em>
 * exists. If found, this compressed version is served. The
 * <em>Content-Encoding</em> field is set to \e gzip for these requests, so that
 * the HTTP clients can handle it properly.
 *
 * \section ssi Server Side Include (SSI)
 *
 * Server Side Include (SSI) directives are mark-up snippets in .shtml files
 * that are detected by HTTPD and replaced with some other content.  Two SSI
 * directives are supported: file and virtual.
 *
 * When the file directive is encountered, it is replaced by the contents of a
 * file.  For example, suppose you have the following .shtml files in your
 * filesystem:
 *
 * index.shtml:
 * \code
 * Hello World
 * <!--#include file=footer.html-->
 * \endcode
 *
 * footer.html:
 * \code
 * <b>Copyright 2008-2013 your name here<\b>
 * \endcode
 *
 * When index.shtml is requested, the SSI file directive will be replaced by
 * the contents of footer.html, and the following will be served:
 * index.shtml:
 * \code
 * Hello World
 * <b>Copyright 2008-2013 your name here<\b>
 * \endcode
 *
 * Much like a file SSI directive, a virtual SSI directive can also be used in
 * .shtml files.  They look something like this:
 *
 * \code
 * <!--#include virtual=foo 1 2 3-->
 * \endcode
 *
 * When a virtual SSI directive is encountered, control is passed to the SSI
 * handler that is registered under the specified name ("foo" in this example).
 * The foo handler would be passed the string "1 2 3" as its argument, along
 * with the open socket to which the response is being sent, and an \ref
 * httpd_request_t that can be queried for the request type (POST or GET) and
 * any url-encoded form data (POST only).  The handler is expected to send
 * complete http chunks to the socket (see \ref httpd_send_chunk).
 *
 * When using .shtml files and SSI directives, keep the following tips and
 * caveats in mind:
 *
 * - See \ref HTTPD_SSI_CALL, \ref httpd_register_ssi, struct \ref
 *   httpd_ssifunction for additional documentation and pointers.
 *
 * - Placing SSI directives in a file that does not have the .shtml extension
 *   has no effect; the file will be served as-is.
 *
 * - Each SSI directive should be on its own line with no other mark up.  If
 *   there is any other markup, it will be ignored and will not be served to
 *   the client.
 *
 * - The SSI directives must start with either "<!--#include file=" or
 *   "<!--#include virtual=".  They must not contain any extraneous spaces.
 *
 * - File names passed to the "file=" directive must not contain spaces.
 *
 * - If a virtual directive is encountered for which there is no registered
 *   handler, nothing will be output and the page processing will continue.
 *
 * \section other Other Considerations
 *
 * HTTPD operates in a highly memory constrained environment.  Accordingly, it
 * allocates a limited amount of memory for various elements such as the maximum
 * URL length, maximum number of form elements, etc. Developers writing the
 * handlers and web applications must consider these constraints. Details
 * regarding these are discussed in the Defines section below.  If necessary,
 * these values can be changed and HTTPD can be rebuilt.
 *
 * \section httpd_call_graph HTTPD Call Graph
 *
 * The HTTPD library fundamentally uses the functions httpd_send() and
 * httpd_recv() to send and receive data over the HTTP
 * socket. Additional functionality is built on top of these functions
 * in a hierarchical manner for the user's convenience. The following
 * callgraph shows the layering of these calls.
