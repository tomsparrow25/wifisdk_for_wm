axf2firmware conversion utility
===============================

Utility axf2firmware converts normal axf image (generated as a result of SDK
compilation process) to custom binary image which will be used for firmware
update process. This custom binary image has various sanity check mechanism
for magic number verification, checksum for every data block etc.

Compilation
===========

$ cd sdk-x.x.x/tools/src/axf2firmware/
$ make

This will generate axf2firmware binary image which can then be copied to
sdk-x.x.x/tools/bin/ for building firmware image.
