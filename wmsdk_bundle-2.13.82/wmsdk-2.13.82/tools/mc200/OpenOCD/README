Introduction
============

OpenOCD is an open-source tool that can be used to connect 
to a CPU's JTAG interface. In conjunction with a physical 
JTAG connection, OpenOCD can be used to read and write 
from memory or flash. It can also be used for debugging via
GDB or other debuggers. 

OpenOCD is often used in conjunction with Future Device 
International's (FTDD) FT2232 chips that enable a JTAG 
connection via a convenient USB interface. 

The Wireless Microcontroller Development Kit includes an 
FT2232D chip on the Debug module, which is interfaced via
the USB Type-B port on the debug module. This allows for
convenient access to JTAG functions via the USB port. 

Using OpenOCD
=============

A pre-built version of OpenOCD is bundled with the SDK for
convenient use. The binaries can be found in tools/bin. 
The binaries are provided for Windows/Cygwin and Linux hosts. 

The SDK also bundles the configuration files that are needed
to work with OpenOCD. The file openocd.cfg should be used 
to work with OpenOCD on the development kit. If you use a
different board, or if you use a separate USB-JTAG dongle, 
then you may need to modify the configuration files. 

For instructions on how to use OpenOCD to perform various 
tasks, consult the documentation provides with the SDK. 

Building OpenOCD
================

These instructions are provided if you need to re-build or
upgrade OpenOCD. Please see Build Dependencies (below) 
before you build OpenOCD. 

1. Obtain the OpenOCD Sources (version 0.4) from the OpenOCD
   web-site: http://openocd.berlios.de/web/. Untar the 
   sources. 

2. To build OpenOCD (on both Linux and Cygwin), do the 
   following from within the OpenOCD directory. 
   
   # ./configure --enable-ft2232_libftdi
   # make

   This will create an openocd executable in the src directory
   that you can use. 

Building OpenOCD with FTD2xx drivers
====================================

These instructions are provided if you need to build OpenOCD with 
proprietary FTD2xx drivers. You can skip this if you are using
the open source libftdi drivers. 

1. Obtain the OpenOCD Sources (version 0.4) from the OpenOCD
   web-site: http://openocd.berlios.de/web/. Untar the
   sources.

2. Obtain the D2xx drivers from FTDI web-site: 
   http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm. Untar the sources. 

3. To build OpenOCD on Cygwin, execute the following commands
   from the OpenOCD directory

   # ./configure --disable-werror --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx \
     --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir=/path/to/ftd2xx/driver
   # make

   This will create an openocd executable in the src directory
   that you can use. 


Build Dependencies
==================

OpenOCD has been built to use libusb and libftdi.

To build on Linux, you will need to install the development
packages for libusb and libftdi. These packages are bundled
with many recent Linux distributions including Fedora and 
Ubuntu. 

To build on Cygwin, you will need to install libusb-win32 
package from Cygwin packages. For libftdi, do the following
from your cygwin console (from a suitable work directory).

   # wget http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download/libftdi-0.16.tar.gz
   # tar xvfz libftdi-0.16.tar.gz
   # cd libftdi-0.16
   # ./configure
   # make
   
   The build process will not succeed completely, but it will
   build the libftdi.a library that is needed. Now, do the 
   following:
   
   # cp src/ftdi.h /usr/include
   # cp src/.libs/libftdi.a /lib
   
In addition to libusb and libftdi, you will need many standard
development tools including gcc, g++, autconf, automake, libtool,
make, etc.

source package as well as from the official web-site.
