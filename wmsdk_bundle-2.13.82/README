1. Select WMSDK configuration
-----------------------------

$ make <defconfig>

All the supported defconfigs can be found at wmsdk-x.y.z/build/config
By default the WMSDK come pre-configured with mc200_defconfig. If you wish to
continue using this configuration, you may skip this step.

If you wish to build your own SDK configuration, you can do so by running

$ make menuconfig (UI driven; only supported on Linux platform)
or
$ make config

If you have configuration file saved somewhere

$ cp <config file> wmsdk-x.y.z/.config
$ make oldconfig

2. Compile SDK, boot2 and sample applications
---------------------------------------------

$ make [BOARD=<board_name>|BOARD_FILE=<absolute path to board.c>] [sdk | boot2 | apps]

Supported boards can be found in wmsdk-x.y.z/src/boards/. By default the WMSDK
bundle come pre-configured for Marvell LK20-V3 (board_name=lk20-v3) board.

Note: <board_name> should just be name of the board without .c suffix.

sdk				Builds only SDK; BOARD or BOARD_FILE is not required for this.
boot2			Builds SDK and boot2
apps			Builds SDK and sample apps. APPS=<appname> option can be used to
				compile a single application where appname is relative path of the
				application in sample_apps (e.g. "wlan/wm_demo")
<none>			Builds everything (SDK, boot2 and available sample applications)

3. Clean SDK, boot2 and sample applications
-------------------------------------------

$ make clean		- Cleans up everything
$ make sdk_clean	- Cleans up WMSDK
$ make boot2_clean	- Cleans up boot2
$ make apps_clean	- Cleans up applications; APPS variable can be used to clean up a
					  particular application.
